# Silent Failure of Firebase Database Writes on Non-Existent Paths

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Firebase Realtime Database interactions.  The problem occurs when writing data to a path that doesn't yet exist in the database. Instead of throwing an error, Firebase silently fails, making debugging challenging.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution using transactions or conditional updates.

This issue is especially problematic in asynchronous environments where the timing of data creation might be unpredictable.  The solution presented ensures data integrity and provides clear error handling.
