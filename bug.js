The issue arises when attempting to perform a write operation on a Firebase Realtime Database path that doesn't exist.  This often occurs when the application assumes a specific data structure, but that structure hasn't been fully created yet.  The write operation then fails silently, leaving the developer unaware of the problem.  The application may continue to run, but without the expected data updates.
